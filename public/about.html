<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  I am an accounting graduate who is learning programming. I am currently enthusiastic about 
  learning programming languages, because I want to switch careers to become a programmer. I only 
  learn programming from udemy, hopefully with my perseverance and intention it will pay off to become
  a full-time programmer.
